  <row Id="482" PostId="394" Score="0" Text="After letting it lay for a bit I think I have a better idea of how best to approach this in the future. I think its best to leave in answers that may have misunderstood the question, and just leave a note saying this is not the answer the OP was looking for because in the future when people search on this question quite a few would be thinking this is the solution. I remember I was not the only one to do that answer. The only time the answer should be removed if it grossly misunderstands the question, what do you think?"

The trick would probably be coming up with a clear definition of the line. I would love to know the community's thoughts on it though." CreationDate="2014-07-13T10:54:37.693" UserId="2836" />

  <row Id="485" PostId="400" Score="0" Text="I'd definitely like an explanation of the difference. I don't understand from your description what the difference is. For example, in FCPX, if I want to do green screening, I'll apply the Keyer effect. Computer Graphics is something I would do with, say, Motion or After Effects, usually. I'd consider that Motion Graphics rather than an effect. Special Effects could be practical (make-up, miniature sets, etc.), but they're still effects. I don't think &quot;effects&quot; by itself implies a plug-in, for example." CreationDate="2014-07-19T22:25:01.913" UserId="6207" />
  <row Id="486" PostId="400" Score="0" Text="Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how to describe the difference, but a color correction for example is definately an effect but very much not a special effect.  I think the difference is probably in the amount of change, but I'm not sure if there is a better or more official difference." CreationDate="2014-07-19T22:33:46.627" UserId="2836" />
