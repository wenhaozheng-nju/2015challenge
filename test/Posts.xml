I think there are two issues here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 . Involvement of production/recording equipment in recording of acoustic music&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The choice of instruments and even technique can be influenced by recording equipment and venues and such. For instance, violinists will often play aggressively in large concert halls, and much more delicately in recording studios in order to avoid gritty sounds. The choice can be as much a matter of musical preference as a technical one, as a lot of people like the strong attack sounds of the violin -- whereas many don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in that sense, recording and production plays an &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; role in music performance -- and hence should be considered an aspect of performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 . Electronic/electroacoustic music&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a slightly weaker point that's still worth noting anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The border between performance, composition and recording is often completely blurred, and electroacoustic music spans the whole spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On one end you have almost purely electronic musicians like Daft Punk; on the other end you have mixed musicians like Radiohead. Both of them use production equipment not only for recording and production, but as first-class compositional elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As much as I'm more of an acoustics person myself, I think it should be said that to a lot of musicians, the issue is one of a continuum -- so they would much rather production and performance seen as one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="876" LastActivityDate="2011-05-09T03:04:09.700" CommentCount="0" />

Solving the second may help with the former.

Most of the online communities for audio that I've found are primarily beginners looking to get started. It's hard to find a lot of real experts, and people who will stay engaged. I think that those who are experts aren't asking a lot of questions, because they don't reasonably expect to find answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm not sure how to fit SE to the needs of the community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of things that are generally not kosher for Stack Exchange sites are really useful for audio, and I presume video - lists of useful utilities that are aimed at a certain problem, troubleshooting issues that require explaining how something works, and 'soft' subjective answers to somewhat vague questions, like how best to approach a given situation. I think this is because so much of production is as much art as science. Come to think of it though, isn't this largely the same situation faced by sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://parenting.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Parenting&lt;/a&gt;?

I'm a hobbyist, and most questions I run into can be solved by reading manuals. I'm not providing highly-skilled, professional experience, I'm providing mid-level teaching to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Scope problems&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/a/133/95&quot;&gt;was in favor&lt;/a&gt; of adding video to the site when that was first proposed, but only because we clearly were't getting traction with just audio production. Honestly, I feel kind of weird when trying to sell the site to the audio communities I associate with, since saying &quot;and video!&quot; seems to dilute the concept. Nobody seems interested. But at the same time, the site wasn't taking off when it was just audio production. I'm honestly not sure what to do here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can say that as an audio (but not video) enthusiast, my interaction with the video questions is pretty basic, and I would just as soon have them on a different site. I scan them for moderation issues, but that's the extent of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Possible Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it's not clear to me anymore who, in a few words, the intended audience of the site is anymore. The closest I can come up with is &quot;audio and video production enthusiasts.&quot; The image is of a high school A/V club. But if we can figure out who would be interested (say, audio pros and people who want to be them, or video producers, or some kind of hybrid of that), then we can use...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've posted links on forums and in my signature. I help out a lot of beginners on sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reddit's music production communities&lt;/a&gt; and the Ableton &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ableton.com/answers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.ableton.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt;. This hasn't generated us much traffic. We do better &lt;a href=&quot;http://avp.stackexchange.com/questions/greatest-hits&quot;&gt;with question titles that sound like Google searches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, right now, I think the professionals are reading print media. I don't have any data to back this up, but I think they are reading Sound on Sound, not websites. We could try to sell them on the interaction of the site by advertising in these publications. I've not been through a growing SE site before, is there a pattern of doing this that seems to work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for beginners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other way to get the site to grow (although this may be shortsighted) is to market it to beginners. Music production is very popular right now due to the rise of electronic music in American culture. The key feature of this is that it can be made on computers, and there are a ton of people out there learning to produce in their bedrooms. In the places I've interacted, lots of people seem interested in &quot;how to do X for beginners.&quot; In music, &quot;how do I make a sound like this famous artist&quot; is a very common question online, but we haven't seen a lot of these despite it being &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/questions/160/are-how-do-i-make-this-sound-questions-on-topic-here&quot;&gt;all but explicitly allowed here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I imagine that we'd get traffic and users by going for this crowd, but the downside is that we'll have lots of new, casual users, and it's hard to say if any of them will stick around or respect the site's rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all just how I've seen things, but I realize I'm not necessarily representative of everyone.

However, choosing equipment is a pretty big deal in audio and video, and you can usually reword these questions to be useful and insightful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Say you need a microphone. Instead of asking &quot;which microphone should I buy?&quot; you can ask &quot;is there a 'standard' mic in this situation?&quot; or &quot;what do I need to look for in a mic for this purpose?&quot; Both of those questions invite &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt;, not just one-liner answering.

While pro-audio and pro-video is generally about creative use of media, security is about building reliable, automated systems that require as little creative input as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a solution-design perspective, this is also wrong. You will end up with a bad solution if you predicate your solution on a particular type of technology rather than your actual use case. The use case here is audio monitoring of the home. There are many possible solutions, some of which may be built with pro-audio gear. But &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; with pro-audio gear excludes a lot of possible solutions that involve less expensive or more specialized equipment.

Likewise, if it were a question about a mic, or some other piece of gear, the OP would likely be able to tag it with &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it is.  At that point, the question is just, &lt;em&gt;what is the name of this&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As somewhat of an aside, I actually don't think the question (or others like it) are very good/useful.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A little bit of research would have produced an answer.  I searched &quot;software DAW mixer&quot; images on google and saw a similar screenshot on the second page.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They don't lend themselves to in-depth answers.  In your example, I'm not sure what an experience user (I would include you in this group) could add.  One could go on and on about Logic, but the OP was just asking for a name... not facing any &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; that needs solved.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to your disadvantage, if the question will likely require retroactive tagging, why not just tag it with the appropriate tag?

But I guess we're far enough along that it's pretty safe to announce:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;We are going to merge Social Sound Design with AVP SE!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going to bring this site to a whole new level. SSD has an expert/professional user base reaching deep into the artistic disciplines of sound design, while Stack Exchange's technical reach is hard to beat. But we are both reaching out to the same audience, so our combined strength will be a great asset to this subject!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;But how does this help video?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of our concerns was that all the new audio content would overwhelm the video community. Video is about 45% of this site; after the merge, that would fall to about 20%. But we've come up with a solution that we hope will ultimately benefit &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; parties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Video will have its own dedicated site.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically we're actually migrating AVP &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; to the combined site, so this presents a unique opportunity for the video community to take over so we can &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; focus on creating a site &lt;strong&gt;dedicated to video professionals and experts!&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, there are a few isolated audio-video crossover questions, but it shouldn't be hard to work them out during the move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize this leaves the video site somewhat smaller (albeit, more focused on their subject); but with a renewed focus, I think we have a much better chance of attracting the audience we need. If the community has trouble taking off, we're here to offer whatever assistance you need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;So how is this going to work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Don't panic &amp;mdash; We're going to start by moving SSD over to the network software as &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Sound Design.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; SSD will be our new neighbors for awhile while we work through some of the technical issues and the SSD community gets acclimated to their new home. This will provide a gentle introduction; be sure to bake a pie and greet the new neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a short cleanup, we'll start hashing out the migration issues (content, tags, cleanup, etc). SSD is already well attuned to the Stack Exchange way of doing things, so there shouldn't be any radical changes in scope or how things are done. We'll use the audio-specific tags to automate a lot of the heavy moving; but after that, we'll simply use the regular migration tools so the community can carefully and methodically manage the remaining content however you see fit. And all along, we'll be working behind the scenes to make sure nothing gets lost and we don't break anything on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the activity starts to wane, we'll circle back and rebrand the Video Production site. The moderators are somewhat audio-centric, so we'll be keeping the AVP and SSD mods on audio and appointing new moderators for video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We recently completed a successful migration of Math Overflow (another SE 1.0 site), so we're already somewhat familiar with the technical issues, but we'll do everything we can to make the move as seamless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned; we'll keep the updates coming.

Video is more tightly linked to audio than the inverse, but good video requires good sound and good lighting.  I think the sound design merge sounds good, but I'm less confident that breaking out Video from the new merge will do anything but kill the Video site further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It breaks up the community removing audio resources that are key to video and also breaks up the ability to ask more general production related questions that are key to live events.  None of this stuff exists in a vacuum, particularly for live production.  Lighting, video and audio all have to work together and cross over as the cross over questions we have had show.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be best for video to remain attached to the site and even expand the scope to include lighting unless SSD has some objection to this.  Alternately, a split along the lines of recording vs live might make sense, though I'm still not sure that a split is necessary along those lines either since there is a lot of cross over there as well.  I just notice that SSD appears extremely recording oriented and not very live oriented at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2836" LastEditorUserId="2836" LastEditDate="2013-08-30T15:49:05.077" LastActivityDate="2013-08-30T15:49:05.077" CommentCount="6" />

You should take any &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; meta discussions to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.sound.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;the new meta site&lt;/a&gt;, as well as questions about the migrations themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the best way to help is to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; create new sound content here, but rather go there instead - this helps us to quickly and efficiently get everything identified and shipped over properly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We're really excited to see the sound community on Stack Exchange grow due to this opportunity, and for the video community to finally have a place of their own. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part two - Video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be posted as soon as we've finished the Sound migrations, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A migration path between AVP and Sound Design SE has now been established (one way) for the time being.

I am wondering if perhaps this comes from a version difference issue.  The original question is asking about Premiere CS6.  Both ProfessorFartSparkle and I verified independently that CS6 does the full screen preview which is not what the user was asking for.  It may be that CC has changed that behavior.  I do think that it would be a legit answer to the question to explain that it is not possible in CS6, but is possible in CC though.  If you'd like, we can also discuss this more in chat (or here if you prefer) as it seems like a lot of the issues may just be based around misunderstandings.  I do very much want to see the issue resolved to everyone's satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also seems that part of the problem may be that the original question had been clarified in the comments to my answer and I was working off of memory of the question and didn't realize that the details from the comment never made it back in to the original question.  Given that, I do now think that your question did answer the question as it had been originally stated, so if you still want it undeleted I would be happy to do so for you, but the clarification in the comments on my answer (which I have since moved up in to the original question) do make your answer specifically not applicable (and still the full screen preview that the original question had said wasn't what was being looked for.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2836" LastEditorUserId="2836" LastEditDate="2014-07-06T23:17:40.570" LastActivityDate="2014-07-06T23:17:40.570" CommentCount="0" />
