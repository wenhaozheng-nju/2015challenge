You could do primarily multitrack recording, in which I would tend to suggest a digital mixing console with different features, probably such as total recall or even DAW controller-related stuff, but you could also do a live mixdown to 2 tracks, which means you definitely want an analog mixing console with many channels, many auxes for effects, probably some busses and if you want to backup multitrack, you want to be able to get all the stuff direct-out to your multitrack recorder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even without mentioning portability, the type of music you plan to record, the amount of channels, etc. the difference between analog and digital consoles is big enough to not mix them up here." />

If we decide&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to move, and don't fit their quota,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; then we loose everything, and I don't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think it's worth the risk.

There is a small community who seem pretty dedicated, but the site is not &quot;taking off.&quot;  I think scope is exactly the problem, for a few reasons.  I think Lennart Regebro [put it best in this meta answer][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So non-musician guys come here and see questions about synthesizers and they go &quot;Oh that kind of audio&quot;, and musicians go here and see questions about making gun sounds and podcasting and go &quot;oh that kind of audio&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;I don't think it stands a chance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I'm all for joining in with a larger community.  However, I think it makes sense to associate more with a music community, where the kind of recording we're talking about is much more common (I think most of the questions on Audio.SE are about recording music).  Is there any reason not to merge with, say, Guitars?  Or the [musicianship proposal on Area 51][2]?  It seems to me that the association would be clearer.  If I say &quot;studio&quot; to musicians they all know exactly what I'm talking about, but if I say it to a video crowd, it could mean something completely different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if we do merge with Film and Video, I'll still dive in and do whatever I know how to join in and help it out.  While I think an &quot;Audio and Music&quot; site makes more sense, I believe the numbers and data will speak for themselves.  If there's a problem, we can always split out somehow later.

If you participate in other forums, ask some of the most interesting questions others are asking there over here.&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Ask the type of questions that take advantage of StackExchange's best features. For example, I've added a question on [Freeware Reverb VSTs][3]. There are of course loads of forum posts and blog posts answering the same question, but they become stale very quickly, while StackExhange's ability for new answers to be voted up and existing answers to be easily edited give it a major competitive edge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?

If you participate in other forums, ask some of the most interesting questions others are asking there over here.&#xD;&#xA; 1. Ask the questions you had when you got started recording, e.g. &quot;what are the attack and release knobs on a compressor for and when should I use them?&quot;, &quot;why does my recording of my acoustic guitar sound so dull and how can I fix it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Ask the type of questions that take advantage of StackExchange's best features. For example, I've added a question on [Freeware Reverb VSTs][4]. There are of course loads of forum posts and blog posts answering the same question, but they become stale very quickly, while StackExhange's ability for new answers to be voted up and existing answers to be easily edited give it a major competitive edge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?

A much larger group with expertise in recording music should be present at the AVP site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, while it's true that many musicians may have questions about recording their music, StackExchange makes it easy to direct them to the Audio site.

That makes for confusion and a division of expertise.

I think there are two issues here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1 . Involvement of production/recording equipment in recording of acoustic music&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The choice of instruments and even technique can be influenced by recording equipment and venues and such. For instance, violinists will often play aggressively in large concert halls, and much more delicately in recording studios in order to avoid gritty sounds. The choice can be as much a matter of musical preference as a technical one, as a lot of people like the strong attack sounds of the violin -- whereas many don't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in that sense, recording and production plays an *active* role in music performance -- and hence should be considered an aspect of performance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2 . Electronic/electroacoustic music&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a slightly weaker point that's still worth noting anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The border between performance, composition and recording is often completely blurred, and electroacoustic music spans the whole spectrum.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On one end you have almost purely electronic musicians like Daft Punk; on the other end you have mixed musicians like Radiohead. Both of them use production equipment not only for recording and production, but as first-class compositional elements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As much as I'm more of an acoustics person myself, I think it should be said that to a lot of musicians, the issue is one of a continuum -- so they would much rather production and performance seen as one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwYW02nf6WM&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ql4Ophbt7k" />

AVP is a community of professional and aspiring engineers, producers, editors, and enthusiasts spanning the fields of audio, video, and media creation, and we would love to answer your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In order for us to be able to successfully answer your question, it will need to fit within a few criteria.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - You must have either a **specific question** about your sample or specific guidelines for the critique.&#xD;&#xA;- Your video piece must be a *concise* illustration of your larger question. Do *not* post entire videos and ask &quot;what do you think?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;- Your question must be phrased in such a way that answers can be objectively voted on by the community here&#xD;&#xA;- Your question should encourage answers which explain their reasoning and back up any subjective statements with experience or recognized authorities.&#xD;&#xA;- While your question should give us an idea of your own style and what you intend to do with your included video, the question should encourage fair and impartial answers.&#xD;&#xA;- **Please do not submit and entire video piece and ask us for a general critique or suggestions for improvement.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When it comes down to it, Audio-Video production is largely a topic about *doing.* The idea that a site about Audio-Video Production doesn't allow talking about our specific videos isn't the way the industry works. It isn't the way we get better at what we do. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, critiques can be subjective, but subjective topics can be okay as long as you make efforts to [**focus them on contructive criteria**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/). We think that video critiques &amp;mdash; as long as you keep them specifically directed &amp;mdash; can fit firmly in the &quot;constructive&quot; category.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bottom line, a video site should be *about video*. Same goes for audio." />

Ideally we could just convert the polite bit at the end to a comment, but I don't believe we have this ability right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I actually do like seeing people being polite and appreciative, and the comments are great for that. Comments like [this one](http://avp.stackexchange.com/q/3142/95) are pleasing even though technically they aren't adding anything - although if there were too many of them, it'd be a problem.

We have comments and chat for that and it directly detracts from the goal of getting solid, time-testable answers to good questions, which I have always seen as Stack Exchange's  purpose. If a question is really a discussion-opener without the possibility of authoritative answers, it doesn't really fit here.

While yes, this is a Q&amp;A site with the intention of building a huge knowledge base of other people's learning experiences, it doesn't hurt to be polite, and in my mind, really helps build a sense of community. Often, I'll read a question from someone that shows that a.) they're clueless, but b.) they're smart enough to say &quot;Hey, I need help!&quot; To me, those are the folks who will end up being moderators in five years. Is it worth alientating a shy, first time filmmaker who puts a &quot;Thanks!&quot; at the end of his question to reprimand her for trying to be polite? Is it worth alienating an experienced enthusiastic producer just because a moderator deletes &quot;Good luck!&quot; from the end of a post? I don't think so, especially when we're trying to promote community growth. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To dismiss general politeness as inappropriate seems as fruitless as not saying thanks to someone holding a door open for you because you're at work instead of a gratitude convention.

I've been giving it a lot of thought and trying to figure out how to solve the issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there are a number of problems facing the site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Engagement Problems&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The demographics are all wrong.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The professional audio community, from what I've been able to gather, is generally quite happy to stay where they are. Most of the online communities for audio that I've found are primarily beginners looking to get started. It's hard to find a lot of real experts, and people who will stay engaged. I think that those who are experts aren't asking a lot of questions, because they don't reasonably expect to find answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I'm not sure how to fit SE to the needs of the community**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of things that are generally not kosher for Stack Exchange sites are really useful for audio, and I presume video - lists of useful utilities that are aimed at a certain problem, troubleshooting issues that require explaining how something works, and 'soft' subjective answers to somewhat vague questions, like how best to approach a given situation. I think this is because so much of production is as much art as science. Come to think of it though, isn't this largely the same situation faced by sites like [Parenting](http://parenting.stackexchange.com/)? Can we learn from what they've done?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**No evangelists with any reach**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know of anyone on the site who has far-reaching influence. We don't have a Jeff or Joel like Stack Overflow, and I don't know how to engage any such people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Not a lot of experts**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm currently the highest-rep user on the site but most of what I do is pass on things I've learned from reading. I'm a hobbyist, and most questions I run into can be solved by reading manuals. I'm not providing highly-skilled, professional experience, I'm providing mid-level teaching to beginners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Scope problems&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I [was in favor](http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/a/133/95) of adding video to the site when that was first proposed, but only because we clearly were't getting traction with just audio production. Honestly, I feel kind of weird when trying to sell the site to the audio communities I associate with, since saying &quot;and video!&quot; seems to dilute the concept. Nobody seems interested. But at the same time, the site wasn't taking off when it was just audio production. I'm honestly not sure what to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can say that as an audio (but not video) enthusiast, my interaction with the video questions is pretty basic, and I would just as soon have them on a different site. I scan them for moderation issues, but that's the extent of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible Solutions&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**Targeting**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, it's not clear to me anymore who, in a few words, the intended audience of the site is anymore. The closest I can come up with is &quot;audio and video production enthusiasts.&quot; The image is of a high school A/V club. But if we can figure out who would be interested (say, audio pros and people who want to be them, or video producers, or some kind of hybrid of that), then we can use...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Advertising**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've posted links on forums and in my signature. I help out a lot of beginners on sites like [Reddit's music production communities](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/) and the Ableton [social](http://www.ableton.com/answers) [sites](https://forum.ableton.com/). This hasn't generated us much traffic. We do better [with question titles that sound like Google searches](http://avp.stackexchange.com/questions/greatest-hits). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, right now, I think this the professionals are reading print media. I don't have any data to back this up, but I think they are reading Sound on Sound, not websites. We could try to sell them on the interaction of the site by advertising in these publications. I've not been through a growing SE site before, is there a pattern of doing this that seems to work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Aim for beginners**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to get the site to grow (although this may be shortsighted) is to market it to beginners. Music production is very popular right now due to the rise of electronic music in american culture. The key feature of this is that it can be made on computers, and there are a ton of people out there learning to produce in their bedrooms. In the places I've interacted, lots of people seem interested in &quot;how to do X for beginners.&quot; In music, &quot;how do I make a sound like this famous artist&quot; is a very common question online, but we haven't seen a lot of these despite it being [all but explicitly allowed here](http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/questions/160/are-how-do-i-make-this-sound-questions-on-topic-here). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I imagine that we'd get traffic and users by going for this crowd, but the downside is that we'll have lots of new, casual users, and it's hard to say if any of them will stick around or respect the site's rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perspective&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;This is all just how I've seen things, but I realize I'm not necessarily representative of everyone. I'm very much on the audio side of things, and I tend to be focused around a few tools and categories of question. I'm very aware that other people may see it differently, and I'd like to hear from them too." />

Check out [this blog entry](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/).  Quick summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can you tell you’re using a meta-tag? It’s easier than you might&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. If the tag can’t work as the only tag on a question, it’s probably a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; meta-tag. Every tag you use should be able to work, more or less, as&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the only tag on a question. Meta-tags, like [beginner], [subjective],&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and [best-practices], are useless by themselves — they tell you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; nothing at all about the content of the question. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. If the tag commonly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; means different things to different people, it’s probably a meta-tag.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In a cruel, ironic twist, the meaning of the tag [subjective] itself …&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is actually subjective. Ditto for [best-practices] and [beginner].&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Best practices to whom? Beginner by what criteria? These tags are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; impossible to define by anything remotely resembling an objective&#xD;&#xA;&gt; metric. In comparison, the the meaning of tags like [java], [c#], and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [javascript] are crystal clear to all but the nuttiest of nutbags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, the question is not about the music (or at least it shouldn't be).  If the type of music is really that integral to the question, it can certainly be a part of the title, meaning it's still searchable." />

However, choosing equipment is a pretty big deal in audio and video, and you can usually reword these questions to be useful and insightful. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Say you need a microphone. Instead of asking &quot;which microphone should I buy?&quot; you can ask &quot;is there a 'standard' mic in this situation?&quot; or &quot;what do I need to look for in a mic for this purpose?&quot; Both of those questions invite *explanation*, not just one-liner answering. Often there is a fairly standard brand or type, and there's usually a reason for that.

Likewise, if it were a question about a mic, or some other piece of gear, the OP would likely be able to tag it with *what* it is.  At that point, the question is just, *what is the name of this*?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As somewhat of an aside, I actually don't think the question (or others like it) are very good/useful.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A little bit of research would have produced an answer.  I searched &quot;software DAW mixer&quot; images on google and saw a similar screenshot on the second page.&#xD;&#xA; - They don't lend themselves to in-depth answers.  In your example, I'm not sure what an experience user (I would include you in this group) could add.  One could go on and on about Logic, but the OP was just asking for a name... not facing any *problem* that needs solved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to your disadvantage, if the question will likely require retroactive tagging, why not just tag it with the appropriate tag?  In your example here, the question was retagged, adding [tag:logic-pro].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, if the tag *is* to move forward, it should be [tag:what-is-this] rather than [tag:whatisthis]." />

It should generically describe a software editing component.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think any question that required the use of the [tag:plugins] tag would already be otherwise tagged for audio or video, or it would be obvious.

I've been giving it a lot of thought and trying to figure out how to solve the issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think there are a number of problems facing the site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Community Engagement Problems&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The demographics are all wrong.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The professional audio community, from what I've been able to gather, is generally quite happy to stay where they are. Most of the online communities for audio that I've found are primarily beginners looking to get started. It's hard to find a lot of real experts, and people who will stay engaged. I think that those who are experts aren't asking a lot of questions, because they don't reasonably expect to find answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I'm not sure how to fit SE to the needs of the community**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of things that are generally not kosher for Stack Exchange sites are really useful for audio, and I presume video - lists of useful utilities that are aimed at a certain problem, troubleshooting issues that require explaining how something works, and 'soft' subjective answers to somewhat vague questions, like how best to approach a given situation. I think this is because so much of production is as much art as science. Come to think of it though, isn't this largely the same situation faced by sites like [Parenting](http://parenting.stackexchange.com/)? Can we learn from what they've done?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**No evangelists with any reach**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know of anyone on the site who has far-reaching influence. We don't have a Jeff or Joel like Stack Overflow, and I don't know how to engage any such people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Not a lot of experts**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm currently the highest-rep user on the site but most of what I do is pass on things I've learned from reading. I'm a hobbyist, and most questions I run into can be solved by reading manuals. I'm not providing highly-skilled, professional experience, I'm providing mid-level teaching to beginners.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Scope problems&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I [was in favor](http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/a/133/95) of adding video to the site when that was first proposed, but only because we clearly were't getting traction with just audio production. Honestly, I feel kind of weird when trying to sell the site to the audio communities I associate with, since saying &quot;and video!&quot; seems to dilute the concept. Nobody seems interested. But at the same time, the site wasn't taking off when it was just audio production. I'm honestly not sure what to do here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can say that as an audio (but not video) enthusiast, my interaction with the video questions is pretty basic, and I would just as soon have them on a different site. I scan them for moderation issues, but that's the extent of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible Solutions&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;**Targeting**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, it's not clear to me anymore who, in a few words, the intended audience of the site is anymore. The closest I can come up with is &quot;audio and video production enthusiasts.&quot; The image is of a high school A/V club. But if we can figure out who would be interested (say, audio pros and people who want to be them, or video producers, or some kind of hybrid of that), then we can use...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Advertising**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've posted links on forums and in my signature. I help out a lot of beginners on sites like [Reddit's music production communities](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/) and the Ableton [social](http://www.ableton.com/answers) [sites](https://forum.ableton.com/). This hasn't generated us much traffic. We do better [with question titles that sound like Google searches](http://avp.stackexchange.com/questions/greatest-hits). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Honestly, right now, I think the professionals are reading print media. I don't have any data to back this up, but I think they are reading Sound on Sound, not websites. We could try to sell them on the interaction of the site by advertising in these publications. I've not been through a growing SE site before, is there a pattern of doing this that seems to work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Aim for beginners**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other way to get the site to grow (although this may be shortsighted) is to market it to beginners. Music production is very popular right now due to the rise of electronic music in American culture. The key feature of this is that it can be made on computers, and there are a ton of people out there learning to produce in their bedrooms. In the places I've interacted, lots of people seem interested in &quot;how to do X for beginners.&quot; In music, &quot;how do I make a sound like this famous artist&quot; is a very common question online, but we haven't seen a lot of these despite it being [all but explicitly allowed here](http://meta.avp.stackexchange.com/questions/160/are-how-do-i-make-this-sound-questions-on-topic-here). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I imagine that we'd get traffic and users by going for this crowd, but the downside is that we'll have lots of new, casual users, and it's hard to say if any of them will stick around or respect the site's rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perspective&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;This is all just how I've seen things, but I realize I'm not necessarily representative of everyone. I'm very much on the audio side of things, and I tend to be focused around a few tools and categories of question. I'm very aware that other people may see it differently, and I'd like to hear from them too." />

But I guess we're far enough along that it's pretty safe to announce:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### We are going to merge Social Sound Design with AVP SE!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is going to bring this site to a whole new level. SSD has an expert/professional user base reaching deep into the artistic disciplines of sound design, while Stack Exchange's technical reach is hard to beat. But we are both reaching out to the same audience, so our combined strength will be a great asset to this subject!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### But how does this help video?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of our concerns was that all the new audio content would overwhelm the video community. Video is about 45% of this site; after the merge, that would fall to about 20%. But we've come up with a solution that we hope will ultimately benefit *both* parties.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Video will have its own dedicated site.&#xD;&#xA;Technically we're actually migrating AVP *audio* to the combined site, so this presents a unique opportunity for the video community to take over so we can *finally* focus on creating a site **dedicated to video professionals and experts!** Yes, there are a few isolated audio-video crossover questions, but it shouldn't be hard to work them out during the move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize this leaves the video site somewhat smaller (albeit, more focused on their subject); but with a renewed focus, I think we have a much better chance of attracting the audience we need. If the community has trouble taking off, we're here to offer whatever assistance you need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###So how is this going to work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Step 1: Don't panic &amp;mdash; We're going to start by moving SSD over to the network software as **&quot;Sound Design.&quot;** SSD will be our new neighbors for awhile while we work through some of the technical issues and the SSD community gets acclimated to their new home. This will provide a gentle introduction; be sure to bake a pie and greet the new neighbors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After a short cleanup, we'll start hashing out the migration issues (content, tags, cleanup, etc). SSD is already well attuned to the Stack Exchange way of doing things, so there shouldn't be any radical changes in scope or how things are done. We'll use the audio-specific tags to automate a lot of the heavy moving; but after that, we'll simply use the regular migration tools so the community can carefully and methodically manage the remaining content however you see fit. And all along, we'll be working behind the scenes to make sure nothing gets lost and we don't break anything on the Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the activity starts to wane, we'll circle back and rebrand the Video Production site. The moderators are somewhat audio-centric, so we'll be keeping the AVP and SSD mods on audio and appointing new moderators for video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We recently completed a successful migration of Math Overflow (another SE 1.0 site), so we're already somewhat familiar with the technical issues, but we'll do everything we can to make the move as seamless as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stay tuned; we'll keep the updates coming. Enjoy!" />

Break the current video.stackexchange.com redirect&#xD;&#xA; 2. Re-name AVP into Video Production, with the URL of video.stackexchange.com&#xD;&#xA; 3. Make avp.stackexchange.com into a redirect to video.stackexchange.com&#xD;&#xA; 4. Update help center articles, text prompts that the site says&#xD;&#xA; 5. Clean up tags / squash any strings that need updating as needed&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This process is slated to happen on Friday, February 7. It'll probably involve a few hours of things working strangely, the site being in maintenance mode, and other quirks. We'll get these sorted out rather quickly, and with any luck most folks won't notice anything but the URL and description changing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means, you don't have to do anything but wait - there's no need to create accounts elsewhere or worry about badges / anything else going away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that, we're going to open up a conversation about who the new Video SE moderators should be, and a discussion on opportunities for us to do some surgical promotion to help bring traffic back up after such a disruptive move.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, this should go quite smoothly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stay tuned, as I'll be frequenting meta this week with additional announcements, and more transition related guidance. Hang tight, we're almost done!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the mean time, I'm looking for some input from you folks on what the new site description should be. Right now, we've got this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Audio-Video Production Stack Exchange is for engineers, producers, editors, and enthusiasts spanning the fields of audio, video, and media creation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This will naturally become:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Video Production Stack Exchange is for engineers, producers, editors and enthusiasts in the fields of video and media creation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's basically removing the audio part. Should something else change?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has now been completed, and descriptions / text shown in various places has been updated. The new site url is video.stackexchange.com, and AVP will continue to redirect here so that migration histories on Sound Design point back to the proper origin. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please report any quirks with text / links in answers here, though it's important to note that all kinds of things will be quirky for the next few hours while the redirect changes clear caches, and cached content on Area 51 / stackexchange.com / etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See? I told you it wouldn't hurt ... much :) Thanks to the awesome Geoff Dalgas for pulling these levers so smoothly. " />

This means that Stack Exchange questions are clearly **not** a conversation between asker and answerer, but a system to generate a reference work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, not only is removing salutations and &quot;thanks&quot; a good idea, but doing this is Stack Exchange's [clearly preferred practice](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2950/should-hi-thanks-taglines-and-salutations-be-removed-from-posts).

Maybe this will help: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of Stack Exchange is to make the internet *better*. We want these sites to be the first Google result when you search on a question, and for people to say &quot;Ah! A Stack Exchange page! When I go there, I'll see the best, most reliable answers voted to the top of the page, and I can find my answer quickly and reliably.&quot;  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To that end, we're constructing Q&amp;A threads, and the answers that have been voted to the top are the ones people on the site feel are best. Having to wade through &quot;Thanks&quot; and other conversational stuff makes it more difficult for future visitors to get to the information. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, people are going to want to talk, and politeness is in of itself a virtue. That's why we have comments: If you feel a question requires a courtesy, then by all means use the comments for that. " />

Now, asides are what comments are for, so I think the *general* rule should be: **Substance goes in questions and answers, asides go in comments**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But when this rule is broken, [I don't think it's worth removing the sentiment, unless you're already making as substantive edit](http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/2956/156003 &quot;I agree with this post&quot;). Ideally we could just convert the polite bit at the end to a comment, but I don't believe we have this ability right now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I actually do like seeing people being polite and appreciative, and the comments are great for that. Comments like [this one](http://avp.stackexchange.com/q/3142/95) are pleasing even though technically they aren't adding anything - although if there were too many of them, it'd be a problem.

We have comments and chat for that and it directly detracts from the goal of getting solid, time-testable answers to good questions, which I have always seen as Stack Exchange's  purpose. If a question is really a discussion-opener without the possibility of authoritative answers, it doesn't really fit here. Likewise, if something is kind of annoying (&quot;hello&quot; annoys me since it feels like we're starting a conversation, which we aren't) then I think it should be edited out." />

I am wondering if perhaps this comes from a version difference issue.  The original question is asking about Premiere CS6.  Both ProfessorFartSparkle and I verified independently that CS6 does the full screen preview which is not what the user was asking for.  It may be that CC has changed that behavior.

Given that, I do now think that your question did answer the question as it had been originally stated, so if you still want it undeleted I would be happy to do so for you, but the clarification in the comments on my answer (which I have since moved up in to the original question) do make your answer specifically not applicable (and still the full screen preview that the original question had said wasn't what was being looked for.)" />

What different platforms offer can change at any time so specific product recommendations would probably be a poor fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, be sure to scope the question well for the type of content you are trying to distribute if you want a list of generic strengths and weaknesses to look for.
